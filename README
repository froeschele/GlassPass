This repository contains a prototype augmented reality password manager. 

It has two parts:
(1) a Chrome extension that displays a QR code to enroll or lookup your password for the current site, and
(2) a Google Glass application that scans the QR code and enrolls a new password ("OK Glass, enroll password") or looks up a previously stored password ("OK Glass, find password").

Please be aware that this is a prototype application, not a secure password manager.
